## Implementation of Stack and Queue Using Linked List

### Purpose of the Code
This project demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental data structures:
1. **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top.
2. **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Both implementations utilize linked lists to efficiently handle dynamic memory allocation, allowing for a flexible number of elements.

### How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place the files (`stack_linkedlist.py` and `queue_linkedlist.py`) in the same directory.
3. Run each file separately to execute the respective operations.

#### Stack Operations:
- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, it returns a message indicating so.
- **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it. If the stack is empty, it returns a message indicating so.
- **Display**: Iterates through the stack to collect and return all elements as a list.

#### Queue Operations:
- **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Removes and returns the front element of the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns a message indicating so.
- **Peek**: Returns the front element without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns a message indicating so.
- **Display**: Iterates through the queue to collect and return all elements as a list.

### Time Complexity
| Operation        | Stack | Queue |
|------------------|-------|-------|
| Push/Enqueue     | O(1)  | O(1)  |
| Pop/Dequeue      | O(1)  | O(1)  |
| Peek             | O(1)  | O(1)  |
| Display Elements | O(n)  | O(n)  |
